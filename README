==== 1. DESCRIPTION ====

Cap2re is a library for working with digital cameras. It can be used to capture
images from camera, get and set camera options in a unified, backend (and
camera model) independent manner.

It is written to be easy to use and extend, with a polite design and clean, 
easy to understand API. 

The library is written in C++, but a Python wrapper is provided as well.

Cap2re is licensed under the terms of GNU LGPL v3, which allows you to freely
copy, modify and distribuite it, under few restrictions:
    - If you do some modifications, you must make them available under same
      terms.
    - If you plan to use Cap2re in a commercial closed-source project, you can
      do it, as long as you link dinamically.


==== 2. REQUIREMENTS ====

Cap2re makes use of several libraries, in order to build it you must have the
folowing libs and tools installed:

    - C++ compiler and standard libraries, with support for C++11
    - Boost.RegEx
    - Boost.Thread
    - Waf build tool
    - SWIG for Python wrapper

To build the backends, which provide the actual functionality, you have
to check if any of these libraries are installed:

    - libgphoto2 (Unix-only, supports a lot of camera models)
    

==== 3. BUILDING ==== 

To compile the library, check if you've met all the requirements and then just
type from top directory:

    $ waf configure

And then run:

    $ waf build

On success, you'll have a build/ directory which contains libcap2re.so and
cap2re.py. 
To use Cap2re in your C++ project, grab the headers and libcap2re.so
and place them in your project.
To use Cap2re in your Python project, make a copy of libcap2re.so and call it
_cap2re.so, place it with cap2re.py in your modules directory and it's ready to
use.
    
For additional build options and actions, check out:
    
    $ waf --help
